    "modalStelias":"This project involves the development of a website with a database of products, which is populated through a form. Users can view existing products and also replenish products that are running low on stock. The website allows users to filter products that are likely to run out soon. Additionally, there's a sales section where users can select products and add them to the shopping cart. Upon finishing, the website directs users to a sales history window where they can review past transactions. I hope you like it!",
    "modalResponsive":"I've used HTML and Less languages for this project. The responsive design model was implemented for three screen sizes, with a primary focus on the desktop size. Adaptive methods were added for two additional screen sizes. Tablet mode: A specific layout was designed for screens with a maximum width of 800px. Mobile mode: This mode is activated when the screen width is a maximum of 500px. It's important to note that screen sizes larger than the ones mentioned above are considered desktop mode."
